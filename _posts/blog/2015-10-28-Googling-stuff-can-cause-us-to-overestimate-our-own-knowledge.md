The internet has changed the way we do many things, from organising a get-together to looking up a recipe. Tasks that little over a decade ago would have involved dozens of phone calls or a trip to the library, can now be completed in a heartbeat. There has been much animated debate about the potential relative harms or benefits of all this, but convincing evidence has not been forthcoming. Now a new study of 119 men and 83 women recruited through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk and published in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General has found that after accessing information on the internet, people can experience an illusion of knowledge. Even if the internet hasn't necessarily changed the way we think, it seems it does have the potential to change our perceptions of what we think we know.

The researchers, led by Matthew Fisher at Yale University, asked participants to use the internet to find the answers to a series of questions such as “why are there more women than men?” and “why are there dimples on a golf ball?” In the control group, participants were asked to answer the same questions without using the internet to help them. All the participants were then asked how confident they were that, without using the internet, they could answer unrelated questions in six domains: weather, science, American history, food, health treatments, and the human body. The result was that the participants who had used the internet to search for answers were more likely to overestimate their own internal knowledge in unrelated areas.
